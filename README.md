I KNOW THAT THESE FOUR COMMAND PROMPTS ARE NOT CONNECTING TO THE PASSWORD AND I SPENT FOUR DAYS 
TRYING TO PIECE THESE TOGETHER IN AROUND 30 DIFFERENT WAYS. SADLY I COULDNT GET ALL FOUR OF THESE TO CREATE A COMBINED PASSWORD
I AM LOOKING FOWARD TO LEARNING WHAT I DID WRONG HERE. For some reason whatever type of confirm prompt I leave last shows the corresponding
character only. I also will note that I was not able to fix issue #5 because of a submodule problem but I am also willing to learn 
how to fix this in the future. Thank you for reading.
